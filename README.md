# external-sort
A npm module for external sorting for Node.js.

# Considerations
This module is to be used for sorting large arrays with minimum use of system memory.
It should mainly be used to sort data read from a stream or a file.
The maximum number of elements stored in memory cannot exceed the set amount.
